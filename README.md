This Bash script analyzes web server log files (e.g., Apache/Nginx access logs) to detect potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, and more.

It also provides general log statistics, including the most frequent IPs, HTTP status codes, and commonly requested resources.

The script is designed for security analysts, incident responders, and researchers who need a quick way to parse logs for suspicious activity.
